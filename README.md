# File Friend

[File Friend](***REMOVED***) is a web app that performs secure, peer-to-peer file transfers in real time that are not stored by any third party. You can also use video chat while transferring files!

1. Send an email invite to your friend that you would like to send a file to.
2. Wait for them to connect by clicking the link in the email.
